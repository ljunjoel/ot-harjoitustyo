# CollectionHelper
CollectionHelper is a software designed to aid with keeping tabs on your collection. Whatever it might be!

## How does it work?
At present the software works by running the java -jar CollectionHelper.jar command from the command prompt. If you would prefer running it with NetBeans you might have to Build and Clean a couple of times before NetBeans decides to run the software. I have yet to find a solution, or the root cause for that matter, for the problem.

When CollectionHelper starts, you are asked to give a password. Give the password "salasana" to access the functionalities of CollectionHelper. Inside you will find tools for keeping up with your collection. Unfortunately, at present the software will wipe out its records when closed. 

A couple of other remarks: 

The search button uses the same name field as adding and reducing amounts. At present you can only search by exact name.

The search and print all functions will print to console.
